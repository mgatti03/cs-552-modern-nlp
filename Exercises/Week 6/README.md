# MNLP Exercise Session 6

This week we will learn about text generation algorithms and evaluation metrics. Unlike other weeks, we have two notebooks this week.

- **Part 1:** You will learn to use Hugging Face's `generate` method to generate text using different algorithms and learn about their limitations. You will also learn about BLEU NLG metric and its limitations.
- **Part 2:** You will learn to implement different text generation algorithms yourself. You will also learn about more NLG evaluation metrics and how they correlate with human judgements.

We suggest that you attempt these parts in order, so you first get a high-level idea of the differences between algorithms by looking at example generations (in part 1) before implementing them (in part 2).

Rest of the instructions are provided in the notebooks. Best of luck!
