# CS-552 - Week 1 

## Part 1 - Github Classroom

Today's focus is getting yourself familiar with the basics you'll need for the project: set up an environment, understand the submission format, and successfully run and pass github tests.

To start, please join the github classroom using the link shared on the ed forum.

Please try to go over this first and ask question about anything you don't understand so that you won't have any issues with the project submission later in the semester!

## Part 2 - Word Embeddings

Once you have finished Part 1, feel free to get started on the notebook you can find inside this folder, on word embeddings.
