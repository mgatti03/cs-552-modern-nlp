    "In this exercise session, we played with different prompting techniques for in-context learning, however, all our methods were quite basic. In the past few years, the research community has developed various sophisticated prompting approaches that have been shown to elicit more from large language models. This field has grown so much that [*prompt engineering*](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-prompt-engineer) has become a legit job position. Some well-known prompting techniques are [Chain-of-thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903), [Tree-of-thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601), [Metacognitive prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05342), [Self-consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171) and etc. You can find more information about all these techniques in this [prompting guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai). We encourage you to play with these techniques and compare your results."
